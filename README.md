## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate AI researcher from Vietnam, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at the **Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT)**. My primary research lies at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems.

Driven by curiosity and innovation, I aim to solve real-world problems by combining deep theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience in building intelligent systems. Beyond my core interests, I also explore **web automation** using tools like **Selenium** and **Playwright** for robust, real-time data interaction.
